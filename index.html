                        <p>On June 15, 2022, I successfully obtained the Certificate of cPanel & WHM Proficiency 
                            - WHM Administration Certification (CWA), which is valid until June 15, 2023. This 
                            certification proves my expertise in managing and configuring WHM (WebHost Manager) 
                            and related services within the cPanel environment, including server administration, 
                            hosting account management, security configuration, and performance optimization.
                            I took this certification as part of the requirements to join JAGOANHOSTING.com, as 
                            well as to enhance my understanding of cPanel-based server management. Through this 
                            certification, I gained in-depth insight into hosting infrastructure management, 
                            system troubleshooting, and best practices in efficient and secure server administration.
                            This experience not only strengthened my technical competence in web hosting, but 
                            also honed my problem-solving and troubleshooting skills, which are crucial in the 
                            information technology industry.</p>

                        <p>In the 2021/2022 academic year, I successfully obtained a Certificate of Expertise 
                            Competency Test (UKK) in Computer Networking, which was held under the direct 
                            supervision of PT BEON Intermedia.
                            In this competency test, I worked on a project to build a campus network, which 
                            included designing, configuring, and implementing network infrastructure to support 
                            communication and data access needs in the academic environment. This process involved 
                            several technical aspects, such as:     
                            Network topology design to ensure system efficiency and scalability.
                            Configuration of network devices, including routers, switches, and access points, 
                            to optimize connectivity.
                            Network security implementation, to protect data and ensure connection stability and reliability.
                            Testing and troubleshooting, to ensure the system functions optimally and according 
                            to industry standards.
                            Through this project, I not only honed my technical skills in networking and system 
                            administration, but also gained experience working in a team, solving technical challenges 
                            in the field, and applying best practices in network infrastructure management.
                            This certification is a testament to my expertise in building and managing computer networks, 
                            which is highly relevant in supporting my future role in IT and network technology.</p>

                        <p>I underwent a 3-month internship program at PT Intinet, an internet service provider (ISP) 
                            company based in Surabaya, from July 1 to September 30. In this internship, I acted as a Field

                            for customers as well as the company's infrastructure.
                            During the internship period, I gained hands-on experience in various technical aspects, including:  
                            Network installation and configuration for corporate and individual customers, including the 
                            installation of devices such as routers, switches, and access points.

                        <p>I successfully obtained my English for Professional Office certificate after completing a series of 
                            assignments and training designed to improve communication skills in a professional work environment. 
                            The program covered various aspects of using English in the workplace, including business communication, 
                            formal email writing, drafting professional reports, and effective presentation skills.
                            During the program, I completed various assignments that tested my understanding of business terminology, 
                            communication etiquette, and negotiation strategies in English. I also practiced drafting professional 
                            documents, such as proposals, memoranda and business correspondence, which are essential skills in the modern workplace.                           
                            By obtaining this certificate, I am more confident in using English in a professional context, both in oral 
                            and written communication. This experience not only improved my language competence, but also equipped me with 
                            practical skills that can be applied in a dynamic global work environment.
